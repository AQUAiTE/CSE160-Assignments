        Notes to Grader for Assignment 5C:
        <ul>
          <li>Name: Matthew Solomon</li>
          <br>
          <li>Email: fsolomon@ucsc.edu</li>
          <br>
          <li>This project still contains all of the requirements from 5A and 5B, but has been fleshed out a bit to become fully interactive!</li>
          <br>
          <li>So welcome to the Miror B vs Serena 6v6 Pokemon Battle!</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        Instructions for Playing:
        <ul>
          <li>Each turn the player on the right (Serena) will make their attack choice first.</li>
          <li>To attack, click the your Pokemon in the center and choose an attack.</li>
          <li>You may also view that Pokemon's stats or any other Pokemon on your team by clicking on them.</li>
          <li>Player 2 will then make their choice and the turn will play out.</li>
          <li>When a Pokemon faints, that player should select another Pokemon from their bench.</li>
          <li>Fight until 1 player wins as the MASTER POKEMON TRAINER!</li>
        </ul>

        Future Features (if I choose to build onto it):
        <ul>
          <li>Allow Pokemon Switching</li>
          <li>Add abilities and effects like poison, burn, freeze</li>
          <li>Long Term: Refactor to use PokeAPI and allow teams to be chosen and generated</li>
        </ul>
